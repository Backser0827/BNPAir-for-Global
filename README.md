# BNPAir-for-Global?
BNPAir for Global is a store about uploading &amp; downloading files in the Internet. We provided the code in https://air.bnpo.xyz/ and rebuilt it to other version. You can download the files and build it in your own server. 


# How can I use it?
It was very easy to download the files of BNPAir. Just click this link to start download: https://github.com/EcationBackser/BNPAir-for-Global/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

After that, uploade the files to the server. If you don't have server or do not know how to buy server and more and more and more and more, you can check it in Google.

# Why open-source?
BNPAir was a global work. So we wanna everyone to know about how to program with PHP. Even though it was still a very easy work, but we still wanna everyone enjoy and study something from that.
